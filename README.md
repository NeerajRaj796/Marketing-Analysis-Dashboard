📊 Marketing Analytics Dashboard – Campaign Insights (Excel)

🎓 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my Consultancy Experience Project (CEP) during my MSc in Management & Business Analytics at Nottingham Trent University.

It focuses on analysing marketing performance data for a consulting firm (name anonymised) to uncover insights into advertising efficiency, regional engagement, and emerging market opportunities in Canada and the United States.

⚠️ All datasets and visuals shared here are based on synthetic data created to mirror the structure and analytical logic of the original confidential dataset.

🧭 Objectives
Analyse and visualise Google Ads and campaign data across multiple regions.
Track and compare Clicks, Impressions, CTR, and CPC by geography.
Identify top-performing regions and cost-efficient ad spends.
Conduct sectoral analysis for Canadian markets to highlight growth opportunities.
Present results through interactive Excel dashboards.
